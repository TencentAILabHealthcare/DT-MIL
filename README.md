python3 test.py
```

## Usage

### Inference

```shell script
EXP_DIR=<path/to/result/save/dir>

python3 -u main.py \
    --output_dir data \
    --num_input_channels 1280 \
    --num_class 2 \
    --batch_size 1 \
    --num_workers 1 \
    --num_queries 2 \
    --frozen_weights ./checkpoints/checkpoint_best.pth
```

### Note for data

You can refer the code in `script/extract_feature.py` and `script/merge_patch_feat.py` to process your own data.

We also include sample data downloaded from [TCIA CPTAC Pathology Portal](https://cancerimagingarchive.net/datascope/cptac/home/) for testing, which are stored in the `./data` folder.
